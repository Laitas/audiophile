## What I learned

- useContext
- Tailwind 

I chose these two particular tools for a reason. First, I chose useContext API because I thought companies don't really use context and they go straight to Redux toolkit. Why? I honestly have no idea. Silly me. I also chose Tailwind because I didn't think I'd like using css framework since scss works just fine, but considering that if I get employed I might not get to choose my own tools, I decided to learn it and just see how it goes. 

### Also, this project is not 100% finished, there's no form validation and persistance for now.
